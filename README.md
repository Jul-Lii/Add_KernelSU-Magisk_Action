# *Add KernelSU and Magisk Action*

## :warning: :warning: :warning: **Read README frist !!!!!**

The ***Plus*** version, can compile kernel, AnyKernel3, boot-kernelsu.img, boot-magisk.img, magisk.zip

The Actions to compile the Non-GKI kernel, with the optional addition of Magisk and KernelSU, is somewhat universal.

**This repository is real, so if you want to see examples of builds, check out the `build` branch of this repository.**

## ***Supported Kernels***

- *`5.4`*
- *`4.19`*
- *`4.14`*
- *`4.9`*
- ***The other versions** ***may*** **be supported, but you need to try it for yourself!***

## ***Usage***

> :warning: :warning: :warning: After compilation, AnyKernel3 will be uploaded in `Action` and so on, device checking has been turned off, please make sure your phone is unlocked before flashing it!

- Star this repository, then Fork this repository to make sure the workflow is running properly.

> Star is a source of motivation for authors, so please don't skimp on your Star!

- Rename the config file to config.env (the name can be customized, but **must** end with `.env`!)

- Write your favorite configuration in the configuration file, whose comments can be found in the lower part of this README.md.

- Open the workflow file (name is customizable, default is [build-kernel.yml] (.github/workflows/build-kernel.yml)) and find the following:


```yaml
    steps.
    - name: Check out
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Read Building Configuration
      run: |


->>>>>>> CONFIG_ENV=config.env.simple <<<<<<<-


        echo "KERNEL_SOURCE=$(cat $CONFIG_ENV | grep -w "KERNEL_SOURCE" | head -n 1 | cut -d "=" -f 2)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        echo "KERNEL_SOURCE_BRANCH=$(cat $CONFIG_ENV | grep -w "KERNEL_SOURCE_BRANCH" | head -n 1 | cut -d "=" -f 2)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        echo "KERNEL_CONFIG=$(cat $CONFIG_ENV | grep -w "KERNEL_CONFIG" | head -n 1 | cut -d "=" -f 2)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

- Change **`config.env.simple`** to the name of your configuration file. If you created a config file called **`config_abcdefg.env`** then you should fill in **`config_abcdefg.env`** here.

- After that go to Actions and click on the green button `I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them.` Click on Options (default is **`Build`**) and you'll see **`Run workflows`** at the top of the big dialog on the right, clicking on that will start the build. If **`Release`** is checked, it will release the build.

## ***Warning!*** :warning: :warning: :warning:

Please **be sure** to first **carefully, conscientiously** read and **understand** the following config file comments!!!

**Otherwise you'll get the wrong product, or Actions won't work at all!**

## ***Configuration***

**Some of these configurations contradict each other, please figure out the logic before configuring!!!!**

#### Kernel Config

(string)

Modify this to the name of your kernel configuration file

e.g. vendor/wayne_defconfig, vendor/violet-perf_defconfig, munch_defconfig etc.

> Tips: Look in arch/arm64/configs(/vendor) in the kernel source.

#### Arch

(string)

Change it to your CPU architecture, usually arm64.

Example: arm64

#### Kernel Image Name

(string)

Modify it to the kernel binary to be flashed, usually the same as BOARD_KERNEL_IMAGE_NAME in your aosp-device tree.

#### Enable Clang

(true or false)

We provide a customizable way to enable or disable Clang compilation


#### Use AOSP Clang

(true or false)

You can choose whether to use AOSP Clang or not.

#### AOSP Clang Branch

(String)

We provide the option to customize Google's upstream branches, the main ones being

| Clang Branch

***Official Google docs are like this, but it's been verified that individual versions can't be downloaded, so if you can't download it, please set it to r450784e***.

Generally, Clang12 can be compiled with most kernels from 4.14 and up.
My own Redmi Note 7 Pro (Kenrel 4.14) uses ~~r450784d~~ r450784e

> Tips: If you still get an error, go to [AOSP Clang](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/clang/host/linux-x86) and look for available branches and versions.

You can type `ksud debug get-sign <apk_path>` to get the size and hash of the apk signature.

#### Build KernelSU Boot IMG

(true or false)

> Merged in from previous Workflows, you can see the commit history

Build boot.img with KernelSU, you need to provide `KernelSU Source boot image`.

#### KernelSU Source Boot Image

(HTTP link)

As the name suggests, you need to provide a boot image of the source system that can boot normally, it needs to be a direct link, preferably built from aosp with the same kernel source code and the same device tree as your current system. ramdisk contains the partition table and init, without it, the built image will not boot normally.

Example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abc/def/main/boot/boot.img

### **Enable Magisk**

(true or false)

As the name suggests, you can configure whether to enable Magisk or not.

#### Magisk APK

(HTTP link)

As the name suggests, provide a Magisk APK file (ZIP is fine, theoretically as long as it's in ZIP format), which needs to be directly linked, and supports third-party, customized versions of Magisk.

If you can't find the official repository, you can go to [magisk-files-host](https://github.com/magojohnji/magisk-files-host) to find the APK file.

> Tips: split the json to find the link is also possible.

#### Magisk Patch Partition

(string)

The name of the partition that Magisk patched

Generally, it is the boot partition, but we can't rule out the possibility that some devices are init_boot or vendor_boot, see Magisk official documentation for details.

#### Magisk Source Boot Image

(HTTP link)

Image file of the partition patched by Magisk, requires a direct link.

Example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abc/def/main/boot/boot.img

### **Build Settings**

---

#### Disable LTO

(true or false)

LTO is used to optimize the kernel, but in some cases it can cause errors

#### Disable CC_WERROR

(true or false)

Used to fix some kernels that don't support or disable Kprobes, fixes KernelSU not detecting Kprobes-enabled variables throwing warnings and causing errors.

#### Add Kprobes Config

(true or false)

Automatically inject parameters into defconfig to enable Kprobes support.

#### Add overlayfs Config

(true or false)

Provide support for reading and writing to KernelSU modules and system partitions, automatically injected in defconfig.

#### Enable ccache

(true or false)

Enable caching to make the second kernel build faster, at least 2/5 of the time.

#### Need DTBO

(true or false)

Upload DTBO
Required for some devices

#### Extra cmds

(strings)

Some kernels need to add some other compilation commands to compile properly, usually no other commands are needed, please search your own kernel's information.
Please use space between commands.

Example: LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1

#### TC Custom cmds

(strings)

Compile toolchain configuration, ~~ you should be able to change these configurations yourself :)~~ Ask the kernel author or analyze the kernel compilation scripts yourself.


## ***Useful tips*** (congratulations on reading through the ***`configuration`*** part)

- If you want to build automatically after modifying the file, you can change the beginning of [build-kernel.yml](.github/workflows/build-kernel.yml) to this:

```yaml
name: Build
on.
  Build on.
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch.
    workflow_dispatch: workflow_dispatch: workflow_dispatch.
      release.
        description: "Release"
        required: true
        default: false
        type: boolean

```

- If you want a daily timed build, you can change the beginning of [build-kernel.yml](.github/workflows/build-kernel.yml) to look like this: (executed daily at 2:00 UTC)

```yaml
name: Build
on.
  schedule.
    - cron: "0 2 * * * *"
  workflow_dispatch.
    cron: "0 * * *" workflow_dispatch.
      cron: "0 * * *" workflow_dispatch: inputs.
        description: "Release"
        required: true
        default: false
        type: boolean
```

Of course you can mix them up :-)
